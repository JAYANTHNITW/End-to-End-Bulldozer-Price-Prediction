# End-to-End-Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
This  project is the one of the problem of Kaggle competion  which was held 7 years back. 

Project 3: Predicting Bulldozer SalesPrice. In this project, I analyzed dataset with the given attributies(54) to predict bulldozer SalesPrice .I used RandomForestRegressor algorithm. Kaggle asked to find the ROOT MEAN SQURED LOG LOSS ERROR(rmsle). I have got the rmsle = 0.246. which is good . I am in 30th position in the leader board with this error. I would say the question was moderate to hard level for me.

In this project, I have learned different functions of pandas . It last i have seen the features which are contributed most to predict my SalesPrice by using the feature_importances function from sklearn

Tools and techniques used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
